ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Baijnath Kumar â€“ and Iâ€™m living my dream.

Iâ€™ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest technology. Today, Iâ€™m working as a Team Lead for Software AG, and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.

I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. To pursue it same I completed my graduation in Computer Technology from Priyadarshini College of Engineering, Nagpur.

After my graduation, I joined Software AG. as an Intern. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on countless projects and contributed to many successful releases. Today, Iâ€™m working as Team Lead at Software AG, and getting into full stack on my own time.

Iâ€™m familiar with software engineering skills likes Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, SQL, NoSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx, etc., but Iâ€™m always adding new skills to my repertoire. Iâ€™m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
